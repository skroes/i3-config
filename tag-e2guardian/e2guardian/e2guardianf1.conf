# e2guardian filter group config file for version 3.4.0.3


# Filter group mode
# This option determines whether members of this group have their web access
# unfiltered, filtered, or banned. 
#
# 0 = banned
# 1 = filtered
# 2 = unfiltered (exception)
#
# Only filter groups with a mode of 1 need to define phrase, URL, site, extension,
# mimetype and PICS lists; in other modes, these options are ignored to conserve
# memory.
#
# Defaults to 0 if unspecified.
# Unauthenticated users are treated as being in the first filter group.
groupmode = 1

# Filter group name
# Used to fill in the -FILTERGROUP- placeholder in the HTML template file, and to
# name the group in the access logs
# Defaults to empty string
#groupname = ''

# Enable legacy (DG) ssl logic
# 
# Note that the logic for handling SSL is changed. In DG when either blanket block (or SSL blanket block) 
# was active then an SSL site would not be blocked if site name matched either exceptionsitelist or greysitelist. 
# In e2guardian with blanket block (or SSL blanket block) active an SSL site will only be allowed if it matches 
# exceptionsitelist or greysslsitelist. This ensures that only trusted sites can be accessed via SSL. 
# The greysslsitelist is used in order to allow a site to drop through so that it's domain can be mangled via urlregexplist, 
# e.g. To use the Google mechanism for prevention of https Google search, or to allow an SSL site whilst blocking the corresponding http: site.
#
# Default off (logic as above) 
# For legacy (DG style) logic then set ssllegacylogic to on
# Note that MITM cannot work with this flag set
# ssllegacylogic = off

# phrases (not just weighted), search term filtering, and scanning for
# links to banned URLs.
# Defaults to 1.
# weightedphrasemode = 1

# Naughtiness limit
# This the limit over which the page will be blocked.  Each weighted phrase is given
# a value either positive or negative and the values added up.  Phrases to do with
# good subjects will have negative values, and bad subjects will have positive
# values.  See the weightedphraselist file for examples.
# As a guide:
# 55 is for young children,  110 for old children,  175 for young adults.
# default 50
naughtynesslimit = 50

# Search term blocking
# Search terms can be extracted from search URLs and filtered using one or 
# both of two different methods.

# Method 1 is that developed by Protex where specific 
# search terms are contained in a bannedsearchlist.  
# (localbannedsearchlist and bannedsearchoveridelist can be used to supplement
# and override this list as required.)
# These lists contain banned search words combinations on each line.  
# Words are separated by '+' and must be in sorted order within a line.
#    so to block 'sexy girl' then the list must contain the line
#    	girl+sexy
#    and this will block both 'sexy girl' and 'girl sexy'
# To use this method, the searchregexplist must be enabled and the bannedsearchlist(s) defined

# Method 2 is uses the 
# bannedphraselist, weightedphraselist and exceptionphraselist, with a separate
# threshold for blocking than that used for normal page content.  
# The bannedsearchoveridelist can be used to overide the phrase blocking.

# For method 2, the searchregexplist must be enabled and searchtermlimit 
# must be greater than 0.
 
#
# Search engine regular expression list (need for both options)
# List of regular expressions for matching search engine URLs.  It is assumed
# that the search terms themselves will be contained in the 
# of output of each expression.
#searchregexplist = '/etc/e2guardian/lists/searchregexplist'
#
#
# Override list - overrides both bannedsearchlist and searchterm limit
# Similar to exception list but only on the search term.  The actual
# returned content of the page may still be content checked.
#bannedsearchoveridelist = '/etc/e2guardian/lists/bannedsearchoveridelist'


# Banned Search Term list(s) for option 1
#bannedsearchlist = '/etc/e2guardian/lists/bannedsearchlist'


# Search term limit (for Option 2)
# The limit over which requests will be blocked for containing search terms
# which match the weightedphraselist.  This should usually be lower than the
# 'naughtynesslimit' value above, because the amount of text being filtered
# is only a few words, rather than a whole page. A value of around 40 is recommended
# for children.
# A value of 0 here indicates that no phrase filtering should be performed 
# on the search terms.
#searchtermlimit = 0
#
# Search term phrase lists (for Option 2) 
# If the three lines below are uncommented, search term blocking will use
# the banned, weighted & exception phrases from these lists, instead of using
# the same phrase lists as for page content.  This is optional but recommended,
# as weights for individual phrases in the "normal" lists may not be
# appropriate for blocking when those phrases appear in a much smaller block
# of text.
# Please note that all or none of the below should be uncommented, not a
# mixture.

# Category display threshold
# This option only applies to pages blocked by weighted phrase filtering.
# Defines the minimum score that must be accumulated within a particular
# category in order for it to show up on the block pages' category list.
# All categories under which the page scores positively will be logged; those
# that were not displayed to the user appear in brackets.
#
# -1 = display only the highest scoring category
# 0 = display all categories (default)
# > 0 = minimum score for a category to be displayed
categorydisplaythreshold = 0

# Embedded URL weighting
# When set to something greater than zero, this option causes URLs embedded within a
# page's HTML (from links, image tags, etc.) to be extracted and checked against the
# bannedsitelist and bannedurllist. Each link to a banned page causes the amount set
# here to be added to the page's weighting.
# The behaviour of this option with regards to multiple occurrences of a site/URL is
# affected by the weightedphrasemode setting.
#
# NB: Currently, this feature uses regular expressions that require the PCRE library.
# As such, it is only available if you compiled e2guardian with '--enable-pcre=yes'.
# You can check compile-time options by running 'e2guardian -v'.

# secure it uses a random hashed secret generated at daemon startup.  You define the

# To allow the link on the denied page to appear you will need to edit the template.html
# or e2guardian.pl file for your language.

# Infection/Scan Error Bypass
# Similar to the 'bypass' setting, but specifically for bypassing files scanned and found
# to be infected, or files that trigger scanner errors - for example, archive types with
# recognised but unsupported compression schemes, or corrupt archives.
# The option specifies the number of seconds for which the bypass link will be valid.

# Enable Deep URL Analysis

#     exception in your browser's proxy configuration.

# e.g. /usr/share/e2guardian/languages/ukenglish/template.html when using 'ukenglish'

# Non standard delimiter (only used with accessdeniedaddress)
# To help preserve the full banned URL, including parameters, the variables
# passed into the access denied CGI are separated using non-standard
